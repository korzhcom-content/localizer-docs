## **Delphi 2009 support**

Delphi 2009 contains the most essential changes in the Delphi product line since version 2.0. VCL became fully Unicode-enabled and string type does not correspond to the sequence of 1-byte characters as in previous versions.
Version 4.0 of Localizer supports all these changes correctly. You do not need to anything special

## **Improved performance**

Now "Refresh language files" operation works about 100% faster in comparision with previous version of Localizer.

## **More accurate processing of the projects which use both Unicode and non-Unicode strings**

Previous versions of Localizer sometimes considered WideString properties as AnsiString because they took information from textual representation of the forms. If somebody would like to change this behavior he/she had to turn on "Unicode Project" option.
Now Localizer scans the original, binary form representation. In addition to improved performance it allows to process different types of string values more correctly.

## **New modules structure**

We decided to redesign Localizer's classes and procedures to improve the performance and support new Delphi 2009. Now most of Localizer's units got Loc prefix, some modules were joined, others - divided to make classes structure more clear and scalable.
In spite of such global code refactoring our current users will not need to change their programs - the most used Localizer classes and functions have the same names and signatures.
