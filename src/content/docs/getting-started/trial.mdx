## Standard edition
Unregistered Localizer Standard translates only first 30 properties on each form and 20 string constants on each unit of the project. So you can apply trial version of Localizer to any of your existing project and see the result, but you can't use it fully as some of your properties will be left untranslated. There is no risk for you since Localizer Standard does not add additional code into your project â€“ so you will be able to compile your project without any problem if you decide not to use Localizer.

## Pro edition
The project compiled with unregistered OnFly units can be run only under Delphi or C++ Builder IDE. If you try to run it separately then you will get the error message and the application will be halted.

To turn off all trial version restrictions you should [register](/getting-started/register) your copy of Localizer
