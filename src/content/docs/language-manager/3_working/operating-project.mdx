Language Manager uses native language files as projects.

The text file with `.leo` extension is used to save/restore project configuration. 
It is created when you open the project first time and is updated every time you close the project.


### Open project

To open project select `File | Open Projectâ€¦` menu item (the open dialog has file name extension filter set to .ntv.lng).
If there is no .leo file in the project folder, then the language files opening dialog should appear. 
Otherwise, Language Manager will automatically open language files that were open when you closed the project last time.

When the project is opened you can open only language files with the same file name located in the same folder.

Only one project can be opened in a time. When you open some project, the currently opened project is closed automatically.

You may also use some [command line parameters](/language-manager/3_working/command-line) to open project.


### Reopen project

The six last opened projects are listed as `File | Reopen` menu subitems. You may select one of them to open listed project.


### Close project

To close currently opened project select `File | Close project` menu item.
