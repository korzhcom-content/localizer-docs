Localizer restricts the use of unregistered copies.

The limitations differ slightly for Standard and OnFly editions.

## Localizer Standard

**Localizer Standard**: if the project is localized using the unregistered copy of Language Wizard then only 30 properties on each form and 20 constants of each unit are translated in the resource DLLs created by Language Manager. In contrast to normal mode the strings marked as untranslated are not put to the DLL and are not counted.
Besides, it displays the reminder every time you call "Refresh Language Files" operation.

To get Localizer Standard registered you need to apply a special registration key that is send to you after purchasing.

## Localizer OnFly

**Localizer OnFly**: includes all the limitations of Standard edition. Moreover, if you use unregistered LocOnFly unit in your application, it will not start without Delphi IDE launched.

To get Localizer OnFly registered you need to apply the key as described in Standard section. In addition, you need to overwrite some Localizer trial version units by the corresponding units from the full version which can be downloaded from our site using the login and password you get after purchasing.
