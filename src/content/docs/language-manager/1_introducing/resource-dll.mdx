**Resource DLL** â€“ the dynamic link library (DLL) that contains application resources (namely forms and string constants) and doesn't contain any code. It is the final product of Localizer Standard. The application that uses Localizer OnFly automatically creates resource DLLs on the end user computer.
The resource DLL is created with extension corresponding to two- or three-character language abbreviation set by user in the time of file creating.

Language Manager allows you to create resource DLLs for the languages you translate to. You need to have access to the application executable file (EXE, BPL, DLL) to make this option available.
