You can translate third-party components resources just once and then use the results any time. Thereto, some developers make the localized resources of their components available in some way.

**Library** is a collection of language files that contain the translation of the resources of some library (third-party, VCL, etc.). The library translation process is nearly the same as the usual project translation.

The Open Library dialog ("Libraries | Open Library…" menu item) allows you to open one of the registered libraries as the Language Manager project. The libraries that does not contain a native file are disabled.

To process component resources and create corresponding library, use the special tool – **Library Manager**. Created libraries can be stored in the separate folders inside the libraries package folder. You may create as many libraries package folders as you need. To register all the libraries package folders in the Language Manager use the "Options" dialog, "Libraries" page. Add all libraries package folders paths to the list.

The main goal of using libraries is to apply stored translations to the current project.
