The repository is a multilingual dictionary that is filled in by the user (translator) and is served for (semi) automatic translating. This tool is especially convenient for the translators that translates several applications with the similar interface elements.

You may change the repository currently used by Language Manager. It allows you to have different repositories for different purposes.

The repository database can be imported from/exported to the XML file compatible with the one exported by the Delphi Language Repository (see Borland's Integrated Translation Environment).
You may also import MS Glossary files to the repository.
